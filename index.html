          <p>Being raised in a family of entrepreneurs I have been an employee or owner of a small business since I was in diapers. My on the job training started shortly after I could walk. There is a great deal of skills that I have picked up along the way like the value of hard work. Most importantly I learned that even though the customer may not be right they need to feel validated. I may not be able to solve their issue but the Eagle Scout in me sure likes to try. I enjoy an office environment but I am not afraid to get my hands dirty if the need arises. I have held every position from grunt to Owner and I appreciate the need for each position.
